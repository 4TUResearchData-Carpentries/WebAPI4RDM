## ðŸš€ Workshop Overview

The idea for this workshop to the RDM support staff from the ducth technical universities is that they know the main endpoints of the weabpi for requesting, download, sarch and upload datasets and software to the 4TU.ResearchData repository. The proposed schedule for a time frame of 3 hours is:
- Intro (10 mins)
- Hands on practice with the endpoints in the terminal (max 2 hours with one break)
- Time for questions and to solve projects/questions/issues they already may have in their faculty. (1 hour)
